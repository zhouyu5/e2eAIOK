    "## Problem Description\n",
    "A problem focuses on fashion recommendations. When given user sessions, purchase data and content data about items, can you accurately predict which fashion item will be bought at the end of the session. To better predict, this problem will provide content such as anonymous descriptive labels of the items (such as color, length, neckline, sleeve style, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "Our solution uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn from each session to reveal the underlying connection between viewed items and the final purchased item, the model is developed based on an open-source model and improved by Intel by adding novel ideas including aggregation the item and side information, fusing different predictions, and enhancing accuracy with a weighted loss function. The enhanced model is called 'SIHG4SR'.\n",
